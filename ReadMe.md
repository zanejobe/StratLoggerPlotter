# StratLoggerPlot
## Plot a Striplog from a StratLogger CSV

Basically, this is a wrapper for `striplog` https://github.com/agile-geoscience/striplog

Uses csv format exported by `StratLogger`, an Android app for quick-logging stratigraphic sections that was developed at Colorado School of Mines https://github.com/jcliang001/Stratlogger

A csv example of a data file is provided - "chance1.csv". This is real data from the Cloridorme Formation, Canada (courtesy of Chance Seckinger).

## The main file to modify is `StratLoggerPlotter.ipynb`
Have fun!
